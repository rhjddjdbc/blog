Tor vs VPN - Full Comparison

Tor:
Tor (The Onion Router) is a free and open-source software for enabling anonymous communication on the internet. It is designed to protect user privacy by routing internet traffic through a distributed network of volunteer-operated servers called "nodes."

Strengths:

    Provides strong anonymity by routing traffic through multiple relays

    Hides your IP address from websites and services

    Works with any application that supports SOCKS proxy

    Free to use and open-source

    Protects users from traffic analysis and surveillance

Weaknesses:

    Slower speeds due to multiple encryption layers

    Vulnerable to exit node attacks if traffic is not encrypted

    Not suitable for streaming or high-bandwidth activities

    Some websites block Tor traffic or throttle connection speeds

Ideal for:

    Anonymous browsing and accessing restricted content

    Activists, journalists, or anyone concerned with privacy

    Users in countries with heavy internet censorship

VPN:
A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a service that routes your internet traffic through a secure, private server to mask your IP address. It encrypts your internet connection, ensuring privacy and security while browsing, especially on unsecured networks.

Strengths:

    Provides high-speed browsing and streaming without significant slowdowns

    Encrypts traffic, protecting data on public Wi-Fi networks

    Allows bypassing geo-restrictions and accessing content from different regions

    No need for special software configuration for most VPNs

    Paid services often offer advanced features such as no-logs policies, better security, and customer support

Weaknesses:

    Requires a paid subscription for high-quality services (though there are free VPNs, they often come with limitations)

    Trust is required in the VPN provider to not log your activities

    Can still reveal your IP address if the VPN connection drops (unless there’s a kill-switch)

    Some countries block or heavily restrict VPN usage

Ideal for:

    Users looking for high-speed, reliable internet access while maintaining privacy

    Those who want to access content from different countries (e.g., streaming services)

    Users who often connect to public Wi-Fi networks and want to secure their data

VPN Services:

    RiseupVPN: Free, no account required.

    ProtonVPN: Free with account, offers enhanced privacy features in its paid version.

    MullvadVPN: Paid, known for strong privacy policies and no-logs commitment.
